            <h1>Body Mass Index Calculator</h1>

            <p>Better understand your weight in relation to your height using our
                body mass index (BM) calculator. While BMI is not the sole determinant
                of a healthy weight, it offers a valuable starting point to evaluate
                your overall health and well-being.</p>

                <h2>What your BMI result means</h2>
                <p>A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a
                    healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on,
                    such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced
                    fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally,
                    strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for
                    five days a week.</p>

            <h2>Limitations of BMI</h2>
            <p>Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not suited for
                every person. Specific groups should carefully consider their BMI outcomes, and in
                certain cases, the measurement may not be beneficial to use.</p>

                    <p>The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with age. Consequently,
                        a child's age and gender are considered when evaluating their BMI.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause BMI to underestimate
                        body fat content.</p>
