## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup;
- CSS custom properties;
- Flexbox;
- JS;
- Mobile-first workflow.

### What I learned

While I was build this project, I could work again with some nice front-end tecnologies, like: HTML, SCSS and also JS.

### Continued development

The idea is to keep build new Frontend Mentor's projects, to improve my knoledge and also help others people showing them diferent kind of layouts and ways to code.
